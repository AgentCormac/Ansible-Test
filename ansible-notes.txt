Ansible notes - Centos
=============

# Requires EPEL repo
sudo yum install epel-release

#install ansible
sudo yum install ansible

the above commands can be run before setting up SSH keys by adding
--ask-pass

SSH keys for password-less access
================================

We need to exchange SSH keys between the servers to authorise password-less access from remote hosts
1.Create a public/private key for control and tower
2.Add public key (control & tower) to authorized keys
3.Copy .ssh directory to each machine so that each has access to the other on the same key/user

Standard directory structures created using ansible-galaxy
ansible-galaxy init <component name>
e.g.
ansible-galaxy init common

Use ansible-galaxy to copy the Ansible role for installing the epel repo onto Centos
(geerlingguy.repo-epel) into the roles directory:
ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.repo-epel -p ./roles
