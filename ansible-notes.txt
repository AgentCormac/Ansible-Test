SSH keys for password-less access
================================

We need to exchange SSH keys between the servers to authorise password-less access from remote hosts
1.Create a public/private key for control and tower
2.Add public key (control & tower) to authorized keys
3.Copy .ssh directory to each machine so that each has access to the other on the same key/user
